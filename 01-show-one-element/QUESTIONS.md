## Questions

---

> If you click the link to reveal more text and then refresh the page, does the text remain revealed, or is it hidden again? Why?

Your reply here...
It's hidden again because, there isn't command for it to stay like that and not to go original format
---

> Remove `window.addEventListener("load", function(){` (and the closing `})`) from **global.js**. Does the link still reveal the text? What is the purpose of this code that you've removed?

Your reply here...
No, it listens if the link is clicked

> Describe the the `addEventListener` method. (Remember that there is a specific, technical, methodical way to describe methods. Your reply should match that format.)

Your reply here...
It listens if the chosen parameter is interacted with
